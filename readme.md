# **Punxatawney Adventure - A AS3 based, Flixel powered platformer**

**Introduction!**

This little platformer has been done for the Global Game Jam 2012 with collaboration by two wonderful ladies who did the artworks, helped with the design, and also helped with the sounds. It was a wonderful time.
It includes a library called Flixel which can be found here: https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel.
